Statistics is a fact about or summary of some data.


What Statistic can do?

What statistic can't do?

Types of statistic
1. Descriptive -> Describe and summarize data
2. Inferential -> Use sample of data to make inferences about a larger population

Types of data (Also have another type but we focus on these 2 types first)
1. Numeric(Quantitative)
- Continuous (Measured) -> Car speed, Time spent
- Discrete (Counted) -> Number of pets, Number of ...
2. Categorical(Qualitative)
- Nominal (Unordered) -> Married/Unmarried
- Ordinal (Ordered) -> Survey question degree

Central
- Mean: Good with data that have symmetrical data but weak for the outlier.
- Median: Good with data that have skew or outlier.

Spread
1. Varian
  - Calculate mean 
  - Subtract mean from each data points ()
  - Square each distance
  - Sum square of distance
  - Divide by number of data point - 1
- Unit of variance are squared
- Use numpy
  - np.var(df['col1'], ddof=1)
  - ddof = 1 => calculate variance of sample
  - doof != 1 => calculate variance of population

2. Standard deviation
  - square root of variance
  - np.std(df['col1', ddof=1])
  - unit is the same with the data

3. Mean absolute deviation
  - Calculate mean 
  - Subtract mean from each data points ()
  - Absolute of distance
  - Divide by number of data point - 1

Standard deviation vs Mean absolute deviation
- Standard deviation square distances, penalize longer distance more than shorter ones.
- Mean absolute deviation penalize each distance equally.
- One ins't better than other, but the SD is common than MAD.
